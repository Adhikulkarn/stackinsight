It follows a multi-page structure, with distinct HTML files for the homepage and a dedicated projects section.\n\n**Main Components:**\n\n1.  **Homepage (`index.html`):** Serves as the central landing page, introducing Aditya Kulkarni and presenting his core information, including his educational journey and a comprehensive list of technical skills.\n2.  **Projects Page (`projects.html`):** A dedicated section for showcasing projects, currently structured with navigation links to the main portfolio, resume, and homepage.\n3.  **Interactive Elements & Navigation (`script.js`):** Manages user interactions, primarily configuring clicks for internal navigation (e.g., to the homepage, resume) and external links (social media profiles, contact forms, email). It also provides an alert mechanism, specifically noted for CV projects.\n4.  **Styling & Dynamic Visuals (`style.css`, `project.css`):** Defines the project's distinctive dark-themed interface with prominent teal accents. These CSS files are critical for implementing a rich suite of entrance animations and continuous, attention-grabbing visual effects across the site, including pulsating elements on the projects page and animated navigation components, creating a highly engaging user experience.",

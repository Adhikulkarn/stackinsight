  "project_summary": "This project is Aditya Kulkarni's personal online portfolio, designed to professionally showcase his academic profile, education, technical skills, and project work. Its primary purpose is to serve as a comprehensive digital resume and a visually engaging platform for potential employers or collaborators.\n\nArchitecturally, it is a static, client-side rendered web application built upon standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for interactivity. A core architectural principle is the strong emphasis on a modern, dynamic user experience, achieved through:\n\n*   **Aesthetic Design:** A dark-themed UI, predominantly utilizing a flexbox layout, with a consistent teal or distinct accent color providing visual emphasis.\n*   **Dynamic Interactivity:** Extensive use of CSS animations, both for impressive entrance effects on page load and continuous feedback for interactive elements, creating a highly engaging and responsive interface.\n\n**Main Components:**\n\n1.  **Content Pages:**\n    *   `index.html`: The main landing page, detailing Aditya's student profile, educational background, and a comprehensive list of his technical skills.\n    *   `projects.html`: A dedicated section to showcase individual projects, complementing the overall portfolio.\n    *   (Implicit) Resume: While not a separate HTML file in the summary, it's a primary navigation link, implying either an embedded view or a download link.\n\n2.  **Styling & Theming:**\n    *   `style.css`: Defines the global dark theme, flexbox layout, teal accent, and the foundational suite of entrance and interactive animations across the site.\n    *   `project.css`: Provides specific styling and animation enhancements tailored for the 'Projects' page, ensuring consistency within the overall dark UI while potentially introducing unique visual elements for project displays.\n\n3.  **Client-Side Scripting (`script.js`):**\n    *   Acts as the primary interaction layer, wiring up UI elements to facilitate navigation within the portfolio (e.g., to the homepage, projects) and to external resources such as social profiles, contact forms, and direct email links.\n    *   Manages dynamic elements like a project status alert, enhancing user communication.\n\n4.  **Navigation System:**\n    *   Implemented via explicit navigation bars (`<nav>`) across pages, providing clear links to core sections like Home, Portfolio, and Resume, ensuring intuitive user flow.",

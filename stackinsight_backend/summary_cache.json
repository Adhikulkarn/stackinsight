  "project_summary": "This project is a personal portfolio website for Aditya Kulkarni, a Computer Science Engineering student, primarily focused on showcasing his academic background, technical skills (with a stated interest in web development), and completed projects. It aims to present his professional identity in an engaging and interactive manner, providing avenues for visitors to learn about him, view his work, and connect via external profiles or contact forms.\n\n**Architecture:**\nThe architecture is that of a static, client-side web application, built entirely using standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It's structured as a multi-page site, with distinct pages for the main personal profile and project showcases. The design strongly emphasizes an engaging user experience, utilizing a modern, flexbox-based layout with a consistent dark theme and extensive custom CSS animations for visual flair and interactivity.\n\n**Main Components:**\n\n1.  **Core Content Pages:**\n    *   **`index.html` (Homepage):** The primary entry point, detailing Aditya's introduction, education, and technical skills. It serves as the central hub of his personal brand.\n    *   **`projects.html` (Projects Page):** A dedicated section for showcasing his project portfolio, providing a structured view of his practical work.\n\n2.  **Styling Layer:**\n    *   **`style.css`:** Defines the foundational visual theme for the homepage (`index.html`), characterized by a dark aesthetic, flexbox layout, and numerous entrance and interactive animations to create a dynamic initial impression.\n    *   **`project.css`:** Provides specific styling for the projects page, ensuring consistency with the overall dark theme and incorporating custom animations and an accent color to maintain a cohesive visual identity across the site.\n\n3.  **Interactive Layer:**\n    *   **`script.js`:** This is the core JavaScript file responsible for client-side behavior. It manages event binding for UI elements, handles internal navigation (e.g., to the homepage) and redirection to external social/professional profiles and contact forms, and provides dynamic user feedback such as temporary project availability alerts.",

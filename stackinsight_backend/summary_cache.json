  "project_summary": "This project is a personal portfolio website for Aditya Kulkarni, a Computer Science Engineering student. Its primary purpose is to showcase his professional profile, education, technical skills, and projects to potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in his work.\n\n**Architecture:**\nThe architecture is that of a lean, client-side rendered static website, built entirely using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It is designed as a multi-page application, with distinct HTML files for the main introduction and project listings, linked by a consistent navigation scheme. The design prioritizes visual engagement and user experience through a modern, dark-themed interface, heavily utilizing dynamic animations for entrances and interactive elements.\n\n**Main Components:**\n\n1.  **Core Content Modules (HTML):**\n    *   **Home Page (`index.html`):** Serves as the primary entry point, introducing Aditya Kulkarni, detailing his educational background, and listing his technical skill set.\n    *   **Projects Page (`projects.html`):** A dedicated section to display his various projects, providing a comprehensive view of his practical work.\n\n2.  **Styling and Theming (CSS):**\n    *   **Global/Home Styles (`style.css`):** Defines the overarching dark theme, utilizes flexbox for responsive layout, and incorporates a variety of entrance and interactive animations for the main portfolio/introduction page.\n    *   **Project-Specific Styles (`project.css`):** Extends or overrides the global styles, maintaining the dark background and incorporating further entrance and dynamic animations tailored for the projects page, alongside core styling for navigation and interactive UI elements within that context.\n\n3.  **Client-side Interactivity (JavaScript):**\n    *   **Event Handling and Navigation (`script.js`):** This script is the backbone of user interaction, attaching click event listeners to various UI elements. It manages internal navigation (e.g., to the home page, projects, or a resume link), external redirects to social media profiles, contact forms, email clients, and provides simple user feedback like an \"upcoming projects\" alert.\n\nThe project effectively combines structured content with engaging visual design and functional interactivity to present a professional online presence.",
